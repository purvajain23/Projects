# Projects
**Health Tracker for Various Human Activities**
_L.D. College of Engineering_
• Designed an IoT based patient health monitoring system using ESP8266 WiFi module and Arduino. It can check
• heartbeat, pulse rate and body temperature.
• ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things
• using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network.
**Reflex Tester for Cognitive Disabled Children**
_L.D. College of Engineering_
• designed a reflex tester for the cognitive disabled children, to improve their cognitive skills
**Electromyography Muscle Sensor**
_L.D. College of Engineering_
• Electromyography (EMG) sensor is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical
activity produced by skeletal muscles. These EMG signals are used in many clinical and biomedical applications. An
electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or
neurologically activated.
